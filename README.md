The development of this project has been stopped but I think that the already written code might be usefull for some others.

Map built using Tiled https://www.mapeditor.org/
Tiled implementatin with TiledSharp https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp

I do not claim that the code is pretty or particular "well written" since it was my first bigger project and I learned a lot during its development.

Core features:<br>
Typical 2D RPG movement and camera settings<br>
Basic enemy combat with resetting enemy<br>
Buffs and debuffs<br>
Basic dialog- and questsystem<br>
Grid based inventory<br>
Multi language support<br>
<br><br>

If you have any question regarding the implementation you can drop me a message on twitter (@slesinger) although I do not guarantee that I can still remember every detail ;)
